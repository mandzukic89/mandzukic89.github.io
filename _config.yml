          - Developed a real time attendance tracking application using android/java that replaces old traditonal/manual attendance tracking. This application provides adminstrator (Faculty/Professors) and users (Students) their attendace data information, such as class subject/number, track attaendance time and date, track missed date, notification history, special features for adminstrator allowing them to orgnize, add, remove and edit data.
          - Used Kotlin/Java API features, Parse Server to store/attain data.
          - Developed an IoT tracking device by using RaspberryPi, I2C LCD, numpad and RFID chip. Some of RESTful API features where implmented to enable communication between the mobile application and the IoT device. As well, Firebase API features were implmented to allow integration to send push notification through the mobile application.
